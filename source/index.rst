Welcome to the Documentation for the Workflow Assembler Application!
#######################################################################

The Workflow Assembler Application provides a space where users can chain internal processing elements into a sequence based on the scope of the project. In this application, users can edit existing nodes/elements and create/customize the workflow in a visualized method. The workflow is represented as a directional diagram that chans together sequences of processes and workers, using the output of one process as the input to another process.

This Application can be found in the :doc:`platform:appscenter` of the :doc:`Ecopia Map Platform<platform:index>`.
