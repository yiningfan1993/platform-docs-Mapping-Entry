***************************
User Profile (Annotator)
***************************

Annotators can use the **User Profile** tab to access their Annotation profile, including the following information:

   * :dfn:`User Name`: User name of the platform account.
   * :dfn:`User Email`: Email used to register the platform account.
   * :dfn:`Status`: Status of the current Annotator.
   * :dfn:`Default Role (Annotation Role)`: The Annotator role of the current user.
   * :dfn:`Software Users`:

      * Each Annotator will have at least one software account.
      * Each software account has a corresponding role setting. This allows Annotators to work on tasks with a role of equal or lower hierarchy than their Annotator role (default role).

         * For instance, an Annotator with role Judger can work on tasks using their Labeler account.

   * :dfn:`Software Users Password`

      * The password needed for logging in to the software can be accessed here.
      * The passwords for software accounts can not be changed.
